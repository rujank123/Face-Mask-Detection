Coronavirus has become the talk of the town, Like most people in the world right now are suffering badly and everyday thousand's of people are dying because of COVID-19, Iâ€™m genuinely concerned about them. So, Instead of sitting idle and let negative thoughts grow day by day,I decided to do what I do best .In the above project i used webscrapped data with classes people wearing mask and no mask and trained a resent 50. then i used the model to predict on a webcam feed.

Detect face masks in real-time video streams in 3 steps:
1. Data Preprocessing of dataset consisted of with masks and without masks.
